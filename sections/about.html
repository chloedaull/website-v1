                Hi there!👋 My name is Chloe DAULL, a recent Computer Science Graduate from Concordia University. <br><br>
                I love learning about software development, data analytics, Machine Learning, and cybersecurity. I have experience coding in Java and Python. <br><br>
                I was born in France, grew up in Singapore, and was drawn by the vibrant city of Montreal to pursue my Bachelor’s degree.
